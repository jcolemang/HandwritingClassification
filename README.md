The main program is located in the Program/ folder.
Run 'python main.py' in the Program directory
You may need to run the install.sh script. I
HIGHLY recommend checking its contents before 
running it. In particular, the pygame installation
depends on your operating system. 

The website server is also in the Program/ folder.
run 'python app.py' to start the server. Go to
'localhost:8889/home' in a browser to use the
site, or pay for us to put in on a hosting
service.

Most of the other files are just for reference.
